    "## Touchscreen Theory\n",
    "As explained on pages 39-42 in the [Electronics Course Reader](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/icgvkl3p4x5m0/gyor3wfgyon205/if0gvqrkz0ue/edogs2.pdf), the basic principle behind a touch screen involves sensing changes in resistance corresponding to a user's touch input as shown below. Resistive touch screens are comprised of two conductive layers, separated by an insulating layer such as air or microbeads. When enough pressure is applied, the conductive layers touch and form a circuit called a voltage divider.\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/wk2_pen.png\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:200px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in resistance is converted to a change in voltage using the voltage divider circuit introduced in lecture:\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/wk2_voltage_divider.png\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:200px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Touchscreens have two main jobs: 1) detect a touch 2) determine the location of a touch with respect to a predefined origin. The first task is usually accomplished by using a [\"pull-up\" resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor). The second task is accomplished by taking advantage of the fact that each conductive layer reduces to a voltage divider. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each conductive layer of a touch screen is responsible for determining position in a single axis. Since we setup the touch screen so that these axes are orthogonal, we can successfully determine the Cartesian position of a touch. To detect the position of a touch along a single axis, we must apply a voltage across one conductive layer, and then use the other conductive layer to sense the voltage between the contact point and ground. After analyzing the circuit, we can determine the relationships below for touching a point along one axis of the circuit, where the \"height\" and \"width\" correspond to the number of resistors along an axis.\n",

    "<img src=\"img/wk2_drive_sense.png\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:400px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, we can only apply voltage across one axis (drive one axis) at a time, while sensing across the other. It is also important to note that this method requires one wire to be disconnected. We will begin by manually testing voltages using the multimeter. Afterwards, we will use the Launchpad to rapidly switch the drive and sense axes to get \"real time\" measurements of position along the X and Y axes. "

    "## <span style=\"color:blue\">Multimeter Overview</span>\n",
    "A multimeter is a device capable of measuring multiple properties of devices, circuits, and individual components. In this case, the [Agilent 34405A](http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/34405-91000.pdf) digital multimeter available at your station can measure the following properties: voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, and continuity. The multimeter is an essential tool for \"debugging\" a circuit. All operations with a multimeter require two \"leads\" to take a measurement properly. \"Lead\" is a synonym for wire, and we usually use one red lead and one black lead (positive & negative, respectively) when taking a measurement.\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/multimeter.jpg\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:200px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the series of steps one should follow to take a measurement with the multimeter. Reminder that the probes are on the back wall. This is a reference; the circuit in question is **hypothetical** (for now)...\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "** THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL CIRCUIT; THERE IS NOTHING TO BUILD IN THESE STEPS** \n",
    "1. <strong>Connect a black lead to the black port on the Multimeter.</strong> This serves as your connection to the negative terminal (often ground) of the Multimeter.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <strong>Connect a red lead to one of the red ports on the Multimeter. <span style=\"color:red\">Every red port has a different purpose; you cannot just put the lead in any red port!</span></strong>\n",
    "The ports are each labeled with what they should be used to measure. The top right port is used to measure voltage, resistance, capacitance, or continuity. The other two red ports are used to measure current and are capable of measuring up to the value (in Amps) marked above the port (12A for the top left port, 1.2A for the bottom right port). <strong> It is critical to double check your port connections before taking a measurement, or you run the risk of damaging the equipment.</strong> The reason there are two current port options and we don't just always use the 12A port is because the 1.2A offers greater precision, but with lower max current.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <strong>Select the quantity you wish to measure (e.g. DC voltage, current, resistance, etc).</strong>\n",
    "Do this using the buttons on the machine: \"DC V\" for voltage, \"DC I\" for current, and \"&#8486;\" for resistance. You can confirm you are measuring the desired property by double checking the units on the display.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <strong> Set your measurement range.</strong> \n",
    "The easiest and quickest way to do this is to have the range auto-scale: hit the blue \"Shift\" button, and then hit the gray button above the word \"Range\" and below the word \"Auto.\" To manually adjust the range, use the Up / Down facing buttons above / below the word \"Range.\" You can see the range by looking at the number in the top right of the display.\n",
    "<br.><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <strong>Connect the multimeter to a circuit, i.e. \"probe\" the circuit.</strong>\n",
    "**Measuring voltages** across components requires that the test leads are connected to the circuit **in parallel**. In the circuit below, $V$ is the voltage measured across the resistor $R$. **Current measurements** require the test leads to be connected **in series**.  In the circuit below, $A$ is the current $i$ through the ammeter (A). To measure resistance or capacitance, connect the leads as if measuring a voltage. Use this diagram as a reference when you are ready to make a measurement.\n",
